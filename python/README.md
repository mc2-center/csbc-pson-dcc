# Publications Manifest Generator

## Setup
1. Create a file called `.env`, then copy-paste the following.  Replace
values in the file with your Synapse PAT and Entrez credentials.

```
###########################
# Login Credentials       #
###########################

## Used for logging in to Synapse
# For security purposes, you should provide your personal access token
# (PAT) rather than your password. You can generate PATs on Synapse by
# going to Account Settings > Manage Personal Access Tokens.
SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN="PAT"


###########################
# Entrez Credentials     #
###########################
# Providing a valid email and API key will allow up to 10 requests
# per second. You may experience errors if this information is not
# provided.
ENTREZ_EMAIL=email
ENTREZ_API_KEY=apikey
```

It is ideal to have an Entrez account when scraping information from PubMed
(NCBI in general); providing credentials will enable you to send up to 10
requests per second (as opposed to only 3).


2. If you do not have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) yet, install
it onto your machine and let it run.

3. Once you have Docker installed on your machine, open a terminal and log into
the Synapse Docker hub with `docker login docker.synapse.org`.


## Usage

### Docker
Open a terminal and (optional) switch to the directory containing your .env
file.  Run the command:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
  --env-file /path/to/.env \
  --volume $PWD/output:/output:rw \
  docker.synapse.org/syn7080714/pubmed_crawler
```

If this is your first time running the command, Docker will first pull the image. 
Note that the `-ti` flags are not required, if you do not wish to get STDOUT in 
real-time, e.g.

```bash
...
Total unique publications: 1866

Querying for grant numbers... 77 found

Getting PMIDs from NCBI...
  Total unique publications: 2524
...
```

Depending on how many new publications have been added to PubMed since the last
scrape (and NCBIâ€™s current requests traffic), this step could take anywhere from
10 seconds to 15ish minutes.

Once complete, a manifest will be found in `output/`, with a name like 
`publications_manifest_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx`, as well as manifest templates
for datasets, files, and tools.

## Next Steps
1. Fill out the manifest by completing the annotations for:

* assay
* tumorType
* tissue

if applicable.

If there are accompanying datasets, data files, and/or tools for the
publications, fill out the relevant manifests.

2. Validate and upload the manifest with the Data Curator App (coming soon!).
